# Are you prepared to embark on a Pixel Quest?
Pixel Quest is an 8-bit style dungeon crawler RPG that calls to mind vintage video games and classic Dungeons & Dragons adventures. In **Pixel Quest** you stear a little witch through a set of trap filled dungeon mazes, trying to pick up the key to the dungeon before you run out of health. There is one health potion available on each map and it's up to the player to solve the puzzel of how to navigate the map most efficiently.

## Technology
It was built with HTML5 Canvas, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in about a week. Using a series of arrays and lookups, I created a dynamic game map and a game engine that iterates through the map and renders the apropriate tile images to the Canvas.

## Resources

The witch sprite images came from [VX Resource Planet](https://vxresource.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/a-witch-for-rpg-maker-vx-ace/).
